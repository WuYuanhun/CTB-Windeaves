# Introduction

### AFSA - Artifical Fish Swarm Algorithm
` AFSAMain.m and AFSASub.m ` 
are code for Artifical Fish Swarm Algorithm.

Artifical Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA) is an animal-behavior algorithm. AFSA is designed from a phenomenon that fish could always find the area that contains most nutrients by itself or its mates, and thus where the fish swarm stays would be the area with most nutrients.

Artifical Fish Swarm Algorihtm includes five operations correspond to five behavior of fish swarm. They are 
1. behaviour selection, 
2. searching behaviour, 
3. swarming behaviour, 
4. following behaviour,
5. bulletin. 

The functionalities that we used AFSA are
1. predict busy point under non-real time situation
2. process a more efficient way of public transportation resources (i.e. taxi...)

#### why we choose AFSA?
As far as we are concerned, AFSA is naturally competent to our mission due to its efficiency. The task of dispatching public transportation resources requires strong calculations power and high feeding back rate that keeps the system be able to respond to current situation in a apro-real time. AFSA allows the system to process and give an apro-optimal solution in a relatively short time period. Still, we improve our time complexity in cost of the most optimal solution.
