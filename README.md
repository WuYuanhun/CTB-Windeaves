# Introduction

### AFSA - Artifical Fish Swarm Algorithm
    ``` AFSAMain.m and AFSASub.m ``` are code for Artifical Fish Swarm Algorithm.

Artifical Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA) is an animal-behavior algorithm. AFSA is designed from a phenomenon that fish could always find the area that contains most nutrients by itself or its mates, and thus where the fish swarm stays would be the area with most nutrientsa. 

Artifical Fish Swarm Algorihtm includes five operations correspond to five behavior of fish swarm. They are 
1. behaviour selection, 
2. searching behaviour, 
3. swarming behaviour, 
4. following behaviour,
5. bulletin.
